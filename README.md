With ```wget -O - https://github.com/readmees/programs/blob/master/setup_shell.sh | sudo bash``` you'll download all of the programs I love. It works on Mac, Ubuntu and lUbuntu. Since I didn't test all the versions, please create an issue if you run into any problems, enjoy!

On Mac you might need to install [wget first](https://www.fossmint.com/install-and-use-wget-on-mac/), or you could simply copy-paste [this script](/setup_shell.sh), make it [executable](https://www.javatpoint.com/steps-to-write-and-execute-a-shell-script) and run it in the terminal.
