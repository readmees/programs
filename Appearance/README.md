# Shell themes
1. Make a .themes dictonary in the home dictonary
2. Press ctrl+H if you don't see anything
3. Extract a theme map and move it to the .themes dictonary
4. ATTENTION: sometimes you have to move a dictonary inside the theme dictonary instead of the whole dictonary.
5. Close tweaks and open it to see your new themes
